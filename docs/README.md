## Quick start

Oreo v1.0 is available for download here [Oreo v1.0](https://github.com/dloh2236/ip/releases/tag/A-Release)

### System Pre-requisites
Make sure your system is running on Java 11, if not some features may not be available to you
and might affect your experience while using the chat-bot.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> For Mac users who are unable to run the JAR file, you will have to install Azul build of Open JDK 11 version
> choose `JDK FX` version. Download link can be found 
> [here](https://www.azul.com/downloads/?version=java-11-lts&os=macos&architecture=arm-64-bit&package=jdk-fx).

<details>

<summary>Date Time Parsing for 'am' and 'pm' for Certain Java 11</summary>

###### Date Time Parsing Errors
> Certain Java 11 versions cannot parse time formats with 'am' or 'pm' input, if any errors encountered
> try other accepted time formats.
> 
> **Example:** use this `17:00` instead of `5pm`

</details>

### Starting up Oreo
Simply put `oreo.jar` into your desired folder and open your terminal at that folder and enter:
`java -jar oreo.jar` and Oreo would be up and running to assist you!

> [!NOTE]
> Oreo will create a data storage file "oreo.txt" where all your tasks will be saved in
> the programs own format. To ensure that your task is saved properly for your next run,
> please do not tamper or move the file from its current location.

You are all set! Start by saying `hi` to oreo.

<details>

<summary style="font-size: 10pt;">If Oreo fails to Start!</summary>

> Try these:
> 1. Make sure you are running Java 11
> 2. If you are a Mac user see [System Pre-requisites](#system-pre-requisites).
> 2. Delete "oreo.txt" file if it exist in the same the same directory. The file is unfortunately corrupted.
> 3. Move `oreo.jar` to another folder and try again.

## Key Features

Here are some of the key features that Oreo has!

### Help (`help`, `help <COMMAND>`)

#### Help Commands
To get you started in the app, an in-app guide is provided.

If this is too confusing, just do what makes sense!

###### General Rules:
1. If `/from` or `/to` has a time, both **must** have a time.
1. If `/to` must be after `/from`.

<details>

<summary>More notes on event date time formatting</summary>

> 1. Only date input will not include a time saved in the task.
> 1. Only time input will set a date with reference to the `/to` time and give the next occurence of that duration.
> 1. For `time` to `date, time`  input, the inferred date for `/from` will be the next occurence of that time instead of
> referencing the `/to` time.

>[!NOTE]
>`bye` ignores any other input after the command. However, appending any characters to bye will be invalid and an
> unrecognised command.

### Miscellaneous

#### `Hello` / `hi`

This input is not a command! Rather we have recognised that first time users are likely to type this input when they
first start using the app. Hence, greeting Oreo prompts her to greet you back and offer assistance. 

Do say hello to Oreo!

#### Other features
There are some hidden features in Oreo which we won't tell you! Play around with her a while more to find these hidden
easter eggs we have planted in the app! 

## Date Time Formats
One of the features of Oreo is the extensive date time formats it accepts. However, due to the wide variety of date time
formats and combinations that Oreo accepts, there are certain rules that need to be followed. This is to ensure the date
time is recorded properly and for the user to input their desired date time easily. 

> [!IMPORTANT]
> As of now, we are still figuring out why `am`, `pm`, `AM` and `PM` time formats are not accepted on certain Java 11
> versions. Do see read [here](#date-time-parsing-errors) for more information.

###### Accepted Date Formats:
|    Format    | Examples                   | Remarks            |

###### Using Date and Time together:
When using date and time together, you must separate the date and time with `,<space>`.

:white_check_mark: **A GOOD EXAMPLE**
```
1 Jan 2023, 6pm
```
You may use any combination of date time formats when doing this, even within the same command.
```
event playtime /from 1 jan, 1800 /to 03/1, 10pm    // is valid as well
```
However, the purpose of accepting of such varied date time formats is not for this use but to cater to varied
preference of date time formats. 

:x: **BAD EXAMPLES**
```
1 /0  1/2023, 43pm    // not valid date and time, unecessary whitespaces
1 Jan 2023 6pm        // valid date and time but missing comma
```

##### Date Time Assumptions
Oreo allows input of date only and time only commands when adding deadlines and events. Also, date inputs does not
require a year. As such, there are certain underlying assumptions that Oreo will make based on your keyed in date time.

###### Only Time Inputs
Oreo will set the date of the task to the next occurrence of the input time. We have implemented in such as way because
Oreo is a chat bot that keeps track of future task for you. Hence, an input without a date would assume that you are
adding the task for the future.

**For example:**

Assume the date and time now is 1st January 2023, 12pm.

`deadline give oreo breakfast /by 9am`: deadline will be set for 2nd January 2023, 9am.
`deadline give oreo dinner /by 6pm`: deadline will be set for 1st January 2023, 6pm.

> [!NOTE]
> There is a **special** case for **events** task!

Case 1: from `time` to `time` inputs (Reference `/to` time - next occurrence of `/to` time)

`event playtime /from 11am /to 3pm`: event will be set for 1st January 2023, 11-3pm
`event bathe /from 9am /to 9:30am`: event will be set for 2nd January 2023, 11-3pm

Case 2: from `date` `time` to `time` (Reference `/from` date):

`event playtime /from 1 Jan, 11am /to 3pm`: event will be set for 1st January 2023, 11-3pm

Case 3: from `time` to `date` `time` (Reference `/from` time)

`event oreo's special days /from 9am /to 31 Dec, 11:59pm`: event will be set for 2nd Jan 2023, 9am to 31st Dec 11:59pm.

For more information about event date time formats, see [Using Date and Time in Events](#using-date-and-time-in-events)

###### Only Date Inputs
In this case, Oreo will assume these are whole day task and will not set a time in these task hence, only the date is
saved.

###### Date without year inputs
This is where things get tricky! Similar to time only inputs, Oreo will set the year of the date to the next occurrence
of the date or next occurrence of the date specified in `/to` for events.

**For example:**

Assume the date is 1st January 2023.

`deadline new years' eve /by 31 Dec`: deadline will be set for 31st December 2024
`event christmas /from 25 Dec /to 5 Jan`: event will be set for 25th December 2022 to 5th January 2023.
`event playtime /from 9am /to 1st Jan, 5pm`: INVALID! As 9am will be read independently and be assumed to be on
2nd January.

##### Using Date and Time in Events
You should have realised that date time for events can be quite tricky due to the permutations date time that are
possible. **9** to be exact. Due to this we have to limit these permutations that make sense, else Oreo would be confused
to what date and time to set. 

You can read [here](#event-datetime-combinations-accepted-) to see the combinations and learn more about the event task
or you can see it below:

|    `/from`     | `/to`        |
|:--------------:|--------------|
|  `date, time`  | `date, time` |
|  `date, time`  | `time`       |
|     `date`     | `date`       |
|     `time`     | `time`       |
|     `time`     | `date, time` |

If this is too confusing, just do what makes sense!

**General Rules**:
1. If `/from` or `/to` has a time, both **must** have a time.
1. If `/to` must be after `/from`.

**Easy Formating:**

For ease of inputting date time for same day events. We have negated the requirement of requiring a date in `/to` if a
date is specified in `/from`. Oreo will take the date specified in `/from` and apply it to you time in '/to'. This is
logical as it is how we usually converse such as: *Dinner on 1st January, 6 - 8pm*.

Example of how it looks like when adding such an event
```
event Dinner /from 1 Jan, 6pm /to 8pm
```
This reduces the redundancy for commands.

> [!NOTE]
> #### Additional Notes:
>- Only date input will not include a time saved in the task.
>- Only time input will set a date with reference to the `/to` time and give the next occurrence of that duration.
>- For `time` to `date, time`  input, the inferred date for `/from` will be the next occurrence of that time instead of 
>- referencing the `/to` time.
