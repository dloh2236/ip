✓ A GOOD EXAMPLE (BOTH DATE AND TIME):
"1 Jan 2023, 6pm"

✗ BAD EXAMPLES:
"1 /0 1/2023" - unnecessary blank space
"1 Jan 2023 6pm" - missing comma

ADDITIONAL INFO:
1. Any combination of date time inputs. Only date, only time or both.
2. Time after date must be separated with a ", " (e.g. 1 Jan 2023, 6pm)
3. If no date is specified, default date will be set as date which task was added.
4. Date specified without a given year will be assigned the next instance of this date.
5. For event datetime inputs, to date must be after from date.
6. For event to datetime input, an unspecified to date will set to date to the specified from date.
